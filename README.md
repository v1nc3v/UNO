This program is my attempt in replicating the popular card game UNO!

This is not an exact replica of the game, some aspects are different from the common rules.

Some general rules for my UNO game:

1. You can choose to play with 1, 2, or 3 AIs

2. Every player will start out with 7 cards in their hand and the goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards before your opponents do.

3. When it is your turn, you can choose to either draw a card from the "draw" pile and add it to your hand, or play a card from your hand and place it on the "discard" pile.

4. On your turn, you can only play a card if it meets at least ONE of these conditions:
		- The same number as the card in the discard pile
		- The same symbol as the card in the discard pile
		- The same color as the card in the discard pile

5. There are normal cards with numbers and special action cards with special symbols:
		- "Draw 2" which forces the next player to draw 2 and skips their turn
		- "Skip" which skips the next player's turn
		- "Reverse" which reverses the order of turns
		- "Wild" which lets the player set it to a specific color
		- "Wild Draw 4" which is a wild card plus it forces the next player to draw 4 and skips their turn

6. "Wild" and "Wild draw 4" cards can be played regardless of the aforementioned conditions in rule 4.

7. These are some common rules which do not apply in this game:
		- There are no points to keep track of
		- There is no challenging, you can play a wild draw 4 whenever
		- There is no stacking
		- Any other rule which was not mentioned above

With those general rules in mind, good luck and have fun!
